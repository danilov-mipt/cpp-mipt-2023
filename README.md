# cpp-mipt-2023
My programs for the cpp class of 2023-2024. My instructor is Mr Stecjuk, a known EMACS wizard.

## Contents
Each `lesson_???` subdirectory has separate programs, which were made on a given lesson or after it. Each of these directories has a Makefile, which makes all essential binaries into `bin` subdirectory.

Directories with other names may be projects that will come in the near future.
